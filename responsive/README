Requirements:

Create a responsive layout with the following properties:

1) Fixed position header and footer which span the entire width of the page.
2) 4 columns for desktop resolutions, 2 columns for portrait tablet, and 1 column for phone.
3) Column 1 should contain an ordered list of 10 items with alternating background colors.
4) Column 2 should contain a div with 5px rounded corners.
5) Column 3 should contain a div with horizontally and vertically centered text which spans multiple lines.
6) Column 4 should contain and image which takes up the full width of the column.
7) Cross-browser compatible.  IE8+.  Graceful degradation where appropriate.

This should represent production-ready code, so show us code you would be proud to deploy.
Do not worry about the design looking pretty, we just want to see the code.

Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Iphone 5, Galaxy S, iPad, IE8.

Notes:

- Build tool : grunt
- CSS preprocessor : SASS
- IE compatability tools : HTML5Shim and CSS3PIE
- Desktop-first build. Since the mobile version only real difference is the columns, than I don't have to worry about other IE8
issues involving media queries.
- Simple approach to handle the columns : 4 columns = 25% width columns, 2 columns = 50%, and 1 column = 100%
