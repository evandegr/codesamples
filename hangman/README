Requirements:

Using JS and HTML, create a version of the game Hangman (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)).
The game can generally be implemented however you want but should adhere to the following:

1) Start game by entering a word into a text box.
2) Display an underscore for each letter of the word.
3) Enter a letter guess into another textbox and submit by clicking a button.
4) Whenever a correct guess is made, reveal the letter in the word by replacing the corresponding underscore.
5) Whenever a wrong guess is made, draw another piece of the hangman.  To save time, you can just decrement a "Remaining Guesses" counter instead of actually drawing a hangman.
6) If you guess the word display a "You win!" alert, otherwise display a "You lose!" alert.

This should represent production-ready code, so show us code you would be proud to deploy.

Notes:

- Build tool : grunt
- CSS preprocessor : SASS
- Ideal browser : Chrome
- Tried to keep things as simple as possible. One Hangman object seemed like all that was necessary here especially since there
are no plans to extend this guy.
- My strategy was to keep the state of the word in an array with correctly guessed letters being filled in and unguessed letters
maintaining as '_'. So if someone had guessed a 'T' for the word 'TEST', the array would hold ['T', '_', '_', 'T']. This allowed
me to easily iterate through that array to check for guesses with the real word array and compare on a char by char basis.
- The rest is essentially manipulating the DOM, validation, and keeping the state of the game correct.
- I didn't add a validation for someone who guesses the same letter twice.
